Making stacking coasters for my mugs. Also just learning OpenSCAD.

None of these designs are final yet, still playing with ideas.

coaster-stack.scad - A stackable coaster with a gap inside to fit an inlay design. Print in black plastic.

inlay-rings.scad - A grid of rings in a circle that can be used as an inlay for the coaster. Print in a different colour and insert.

seigaiha.scad - A seigaiha pattern that can be used as an inlay for the coaster. Print in a different colour and insert.

parapet.scad - A crenelated battlement design on the edge of the coster
